# Quick Spell Check

An Obsidian plugin for checking spelling and accepting suggestions using keyboard shortcuts, without needing to move your mouse.

Realistically, it's not as accurate as the native Obsidian spell-check, but it's much faster, and works ~90% of the time.

## Features

-   **Accept top suggestion**: Automatically replaces the nearest misspelled word on the current line with the top spelling suggestion
-   **Open spelling menu**: Opens a menu with spelling suggestions for the nearest misspelled word. Press the hotkey again to cycle through other misspelled words on the line
-   **Custom dictionary**: Add words to a custom dictionary through settings or directly from the spelling menu
